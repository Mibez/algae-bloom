### Current Status Assessment

The current bloom index of 3 for Location Grid ID 4_9 is slightly above the historical August average of 2.85. This indicates marginally elevated conditions compared to typical late-August levels.

### Short-Term Projection
Algae levels are anticipated to remain slightly elevated for the remainder of August, consistent with current observations. A decline in the bloom index is projected for September, aligning with the historical average of 2.62.

### Business Advisory: Coastal Retail

Considering the slightly elevated bloom index for late August, a moderate reduction in beach-related tourism traffic is probable. Ice cream kiosks may experience reduced demand, particularly during peak afternoon hours; adjust operating hours or focus marketing on non-water-related draws. For September, while bloom levels are projected to decrease, the natural seasonal decline in tourism will likely persist; prepare for lower overall foot traffic and adjust staffing/inventory accordingly."
